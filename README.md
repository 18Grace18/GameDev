Lua projects 
Note: To be able to run the project files, you must first download and install the Solar2D (formerly Corona Simulator) from the website first -> https://solar2d.com/

After installed, the user must open the Corona (Solar2D) Simulator, then click on the Open Project. Then you can navigate through the one of the project folders before selecting on the main file of each program folder to enable the program to run.

Note that the resolution view of the program may be different for each device. To set up the resolution view correctly, you can set it up by clicking on the View tab of the program -> View as -> Select one of the devices resolution (it can be ranged from iPad, Samsung, or even custom resolutions, etc.)

Recommended resolution for each program:

Gravity Test: Pixel 4a 1080x2340

Prototype Running Game: iPad Pro 2048x2732

Zero Gravity: Custom Device 3500x2500

Instruction for each program:

Gravity Test: Type 'Spacebar' in order to jump. Type '< (Left)' Button to decrease gravity level while typing '> (Right)' increase the gravity level by one. Try to test jumping with both low and high level gravity! 

Prototype Running Game: Type 'Spacebar' to jump to collect cubes and avoid murder robots. Try to survive with 5 lives and collect the most points. If the lives reaches zero it is game over!
